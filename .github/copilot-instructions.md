# Instructions for writing code in Florence 2 C# lab project

## the research folder

Under the reaserach folder are several files that are not directly a part of the project, but provide stubs,
or other hints on how the data structures should be.

## We use modern CSharp

Code is written in C# 12 and .NET 8.0.

We prefer ImageSharp for all image related tasks.

When building UI, we use AvaloniaUI and CommubnityToolkt MVVM framework.
