## References

The code in this repository was inspired by the following repositories:

- [https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/Florence-2-*](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/Florence-2-large)
  
  The model files and pre processor configurations

- [https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-*](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large)

  This repo uses PyTorch/transformers. I believe this is the official version. It has inspired the post processing of the model output.
